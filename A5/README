Extra Features:

Notes:
- Turning on shadows will cause the framerate to drop because there are so
 many objects in the game (trees specifically) and shadow volume is a multi-
 pass rendering algorithm.
- Instead of shadow maps, I implemented Shadow volumes because I thought I'd
 learn more
- With the shadows on, there is a large amount of Z-fighting. I tried a lot of
 things but they did not fix it. Will fix this in the future.
