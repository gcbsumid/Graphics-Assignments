This program uses the shaders appearing in
	shader.vert
	shader.frag
To try the three shader, copy the .vert and .frag files to shader.vert and
shader.frag.

The program uses glutSolidTeapot to draw the teapot.  There is a know problem
with this object (the vertex orientation of the polygons is backwards from
OpenGL) and thus the call to 'glFrontFace(GL_CW)' before glutSolidTeapot().
Normally, you wouldn't have such a call to glFrontFace().

Also note that in the specular.vert program, pos_EC is the coordinates of
the current point relative to the viewpoint.  Thus, ignoring the homogeneous
coordinate, it also represents a vector from the eye to the point on the
surface.  In the computation of the halfway vector, we compute light_EC-pos_EC
(normalized, of course) rather than light_EC+pos_EC because pos_EC points the 
wrong way.
